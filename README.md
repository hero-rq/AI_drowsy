This app begins by setting up directories to load images of closed and open eyes, followed by images of yawning and non-yawning faces. These images are then labeled and split into training and testing sets to prepare for building two convolutional neural networks (CNNs). One CNN is trained to recognize whether eyes are open or closed, while the other identifies yawning. With the help of image augmentation and categorical labels, the networks are trained using a stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) optimizer, ensuring they learn to classify images effectively.

The real magic happens when the trained models are loaded and tested on new images to detect drowsiness. The script employs eye and mouth detectors to locate these features in each image. By processing these regions and feeding them into the respective CNNs, it determines whether the driver's eyes are closed or if they are yawning. It counts these occurrences, calculates a drowsiness score based on a simple formula, and finally, decides if the driver is drowsy. With a blend of image processing, machine learning, and a dash of statistical computation, this project not only showcases the power of AI but also provides a practical solution for enhancing driver safety.
